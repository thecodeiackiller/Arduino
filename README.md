# Arduino Projects and Low-Level Programming Concepts

Welcome to my Arduino projects repository! As a software engineer, I'm diving into the world of Arduino to deepen my understanding of low-level programming concepts, including:

- **Stack and Heap Management**: Exploring memory allocation and deallocation, understanding stack overflow, and heap fragmentation.
- **Garbage Collection**: Learning how memory management is handled in environments without automatic garbage collection.
- **Memory Management**: Gaining hands-on experience with manual memory management and optimization techniques.

This repository contains various Arduino projects designed to illustrate these concepts in a practical and tangible way. Through these projects, I aim to bridge the gap between high-level programming and the intricacies of low-level system operations.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and join me on this journey of understanding the fundamentals that underpin our software systems.

## Projects Included
- **Project 1: Stack Usage Example**: Demonstrates stack allocation and potential overflow scenarios.
- **Project 2: Heap Allocation**: Showcases dynamic memory allocation and management on the heap.
- **Project 3: Memory Optimization**: Techniques for optimizing memory usage in resource-constrained environments.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arduino-low-level-concepts.git
    ```
2. **Open in Arduino IDE**: Load the project files into the Arduino IDE.
3. **Upload to Your Arduino Board**: Connect your Arduino board and upload the code to start experimenting.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Whether it's improving documentation, adding new examples, or optimizing existing code, feel free to create a pull request.

By working on these projects, I aim to build a solid foundation in low-level programming and memory management, essential skills for any software engineer.
